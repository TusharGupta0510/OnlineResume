    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Siemens Digital Industries Software @Mendix</h3>
    <h4>Student Intern</h4> 
    <ul>
        <li>Created a Mendix application themed around a shopping app, featuring multiple associations among various entities such as products, customers, orders, and categories.
            Conducted detailed performance testing on key parameters like network speed, data retrieval rates, and data size. This testing process involved simulating various
            network conditions and data loads to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement. By analyzing the performance data, key issues were identified and addressed, 
            leading to a significant enhancement in application efficiency and user experience.
        </li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a robust Employee Management System using REST API and deployed it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This project provided a practical understanding 
            of API integration, cloud database management, and CRUD operations, resulting in a scalable solution that enhanced data management processes. Thoroughly tested the 
            system using Postman to ensure reliability and performance.
        </li>
        <li>Completed the Mendix Rapid Developer course, significantly advancing my proficiency in Mendix development, which contributed to the development and deployment of 
            the Mendix application.
        </li>
        <li>Acquired knowledge in Java, including JDBC, through the development of learning projects. This experience enabled a deeper understanding of how Java applications 
            interact with databases, fostering the ability to develop more efficient and effective software solutions.
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h3>Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Pvt. Ltd.</h3>
    <h4>Student Intern</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Worked on introducing the telematics unit of MINI MACHINES, which are compact excavators or machinery designed for light-duty tasks in construction and landscaping, 
            by integrating advanced features for real-time monitoring. Conducted thorough feasibility studies and implemented innovative solutions to optimize data collection 
            using available sensors, resulting in improved operational efficiency and reliability of the telematics system. For example, in the absence of dedicated RPM sensors, 
            utilized alternate sensor data by leveraging frequencies from the alternator to accurately determine engine RPM, thereby improving data accuracy and operational insights.
        </li>
        <li>Designed and implemented updated circuitry for MINI Machines, ensuring precise functionality and seamless integration into existing systems with revised designs.</li>
        <li>This solution was extended for use as a localization initiative to be used in imported machines from Hitachi.</li>
        <li>This project has been considered for actual development and productionisation.</li>
    </ul>
